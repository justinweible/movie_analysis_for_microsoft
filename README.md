## Business Problem
Microsoft wants to create original video content and are going to create a movie studio.
They are looking for recommendations about what types of films are doing well at the box office in order to decide what types of movies to make.

## Methods
* Datasets from IMDB and Box Office Mojo were used to analyze movies that were released from 2010-2018.
* Approximately 3,000 movies were analyzed based on movie title, genre, budget, and total gross revenue generated.
* That data was then cleaned and analyzed for trends in genre popularity, genre revenue, and genre budgets based on the period from 2010 to 2018.

## Analysis
### From 2010 to 2018, movie studios favored the genres of Drama, Action, Comedy, and Adventure when making movies.

### The Standard Score for the popularity of each genre based on the number of votes received on IMDB for their ratings system shows that movie studios were correct to release Drama, Action, Comedy, and Adventure movies. Those genres are clearly the most popular.

### The revenue of popular genres also seems to trend with how popular the genre happens to be.

### There is a positive correlation between how much money is spent on the production budget of a movie and how much revenue is generated. However, it's not a guarantee that high production costs will guarantee high revenues.

## Next Steps:
### -The datasets that were used only cover the period from 2010-2018. More recent data from 2019-2021 would be helpful to determine up-to-date trends.

### -Additional analyses on streaming services would be helpful since there has been an increase in popularity of services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and movie studios are releasing movies that are exclusive to those platforms which could affect box office performance.<br>

### -Many movie theaters were closed in 2020 and in early 2021 due to COVID-19, so the future of box office revenues is unclear until more data is known about movie revenues after most movie theaters have reopened.
